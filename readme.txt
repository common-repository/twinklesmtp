== Description ==

<p>The Twinkle SMTP plugin connects email service providers for WordPress that resolves your email delivery issue by sending emails fast and securely. Twinkle SMTP ensures that all of your emails are delivered on time by using faster transmission.</p>

<p>WordPress does not include an built-in SMTP feature. For mail delivery, it instead makes use of a function called wp_mail. Most form builder plugins, including Elementor's form builder, use the wp_mail function to deliver the emails.
The wp_mail function depends on the send_mail function. When this send_mail function is disabled, then the wp_mail function also becomes disable. As a result, sending emails becomes difficult.
</p>

<p>In this situation, installation and configuration of an SMTP plugin like Twinkle SMTP can solve every issue regarding email sending for your wordpress site. This will keep your emails from ending up in the recipient’s spam folders.</p>

<p>Twinkle SMTP improves your mailing service more efficiently and securely. It always keeps track of your emails by preserving a log of them. Additionally, a complete activity report of email deliverability information in graphical form is available.</p>
